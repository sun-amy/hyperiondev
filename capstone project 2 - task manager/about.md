In this project, I was provided with an existing code file, and asked to extend its functionality by doing the following:
- refactor the code to create functions for each of the working options on the menu: register user, adding task, view all tasks and view my tasks.
- add onto the register user function to prevent duplicate usernames.
- add onto the view mine function to make it easier to read, displayed with a corresponding number, allow the user to select a task to amend using that number,
  either to mark it as complete, assign it to a different user or change the due date only if it's not been completed already.
- add generates report option to the menu.
- write the generates report function so that it create two txt files, task overview which contains stats about all the tasks, and user overview which contains stats
  about each user registered in the system and their assigned tasks.
- modify the menu option so that the display stats option displays the data from the two txt files mentioned earlier in an easy to read format when the logged in
  user is admin. 

Note: I have included both the original code and my final version in this folder.
